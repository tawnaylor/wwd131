            <h2>Enos 1:3-8</h2>
            <p>
                And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.

            <h2>Alma 57:26</h2>
            <p>
                And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believeâ€”that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.
